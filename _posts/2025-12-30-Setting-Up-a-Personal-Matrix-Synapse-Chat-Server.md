## Personal Matrix Chat Server With Synapse

During the holidays I embarked on a journey to set up a matrix synapse server on my old MacBook Air running linux mint cinnamon. 

Matrix synapse is a decentralized federated communications system that can be self-hosted on your home server.

I chronicled my journey here to help future adventurers: 

###You will need to sign up/already have a few services for this project: 

1. Valid e-mail.
2. Domain name. 
3. Cloudflare free tier account.

There’s a few ways to install a matrix synapse server, but a fairly straightforward way is to do it via a docker image found here: [synapse](https://hub.docker.com/r/matrixdotorg/synapse)
